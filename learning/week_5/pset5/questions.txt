0.  The "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" word
    is the longest word I've ever seen!
1.  getrusage - get resource usage.
2.  There are 16 fields in a variable of struct rusage type.
3.  To check if the addresses b and a are incorrect.
4.  The main cycle of the main() function works while not end-of-file and
    reads each character and then checks it:
        -if the current character is one of alphabet letters or it is an
            apostrophe, then we store the character to the array that can store
            a word of 46 characters length.
            -if the number of characters in a word is more than specified
                by the LENGTH constant, we skip all the following letters until
                we find a space or another symbol.
        -else if we found a number in a word, we consume remainder of the word.
        -else if we found something another except alphabetical letters
            or apostrophes we can guess that it is a space symbol and we have read
            a word. So now we have to check the spelling of the word.

    That's we read the words that should be length of 46 symbols and contain
    alphabetical letters and apostrophes only.
5.  Using of the fscanf() function is possible but it might be slower
    than using the fgetc() funcion.
6.  It is done because given arguments must not changed in the check() and
    load() functions. Otherwise the result will not be correct.
