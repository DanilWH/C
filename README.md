# Learning C and also Computer Science in some sense.
This repsitory includes two folders: **"learning"** and **"practice"**. 
**"learning"** is related to learning of the C programming language and also learning
    of Computer Science in some way using the excellent CS50 course. 
**"practice"** stores my Computer Science projects where I do practice.

There are included README.md files in almost each folder with descriptions of
what some particular folder keeps and what it is intended for.
